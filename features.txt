Week 2 - February 24, 2023

Based on line42+43, we are writing psuedocode:

# another question; do you want to add another number. if yes, it will say what is third number
# person inputs number, do you want to add another numberif yes, it will say what is fourth number

if yes, then execute function
else: don't execute

materials: use loop, functions (with parameters) and variable (count +=, increment)

# loop will be for "do you want to add another number"

moreQuestion = input("Do you want to add another number? Y/N")
if moreQuestion == Y:
    yesQuestion = True
    while True:
        startNumber()
else: 
    print("Byebye")

# function will be for "it will say what is third, fourth... number"
# parameter = third, fourth, fifth...
    # increment is inside the function

def startNumber(num):
    # ask the question and store it in a variable
    num = input("Please input the {} number you would like to add\n")
    print("Ok, the total is" + num)

--------
Week 3:
- Psuedo-code:
goal: a loop that asks "do you want to add another number?"
flower = true
while flower:
    "do you want to add another number?"
    if yes:
        that blob 
    else:
        do that












Bugs to fix:
- Currently, the calculator cannot add decimals


- We might want to allow people to do calculations like 8+2-2/5 (enter a lump of numbers)
    this can happen just at the very beginning, instead of asking +,-, we give another 
    that allows people to enter it all
- We should also let people do 8 + 2 - 6 in steps individually
- Can we somehow do a memory function? How would that work or what would it look like? 
    "solved: 1; working on two" then they will try to recall the math they have done

want to write tests/scripts for this
    look up: python unit tests in vscode
